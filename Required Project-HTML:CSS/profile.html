        <p>I'm so excited for this—it's my first webpage and I can't wait for you to see it. I'm here to learn to code and demistify the inner workings of the web. From politics to sprituality, this is the era of change from within, and I'm taking every moment to challenge my understanding and reach beyond what I sought out yesterday. A new career, from fitness journalist to software engineer, will give me the freedom to move light years ahead into the future.</p>

        <p>I can already tell NYCDA will be part of that transformation for me, what, with them having us create webpages before even being accepted. They're uniquely bold that way—like me. I'm hoping I can rise to this occasion. So lean in and enjoy the show!</p>

<!-- Alright so let’s put it all together! Most of us are familiar with Facebook by now but if you are not here is a link (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. to the main website. Two of the main features of Facebook online person profile creation and photo galleries. Let’s try to create two simple web pages that accomplish the same goal. Start with the following:

 

1. Create a folder on your Desktop named Foundations Project

2. Create three files within this folder named as follows:

profile.html

gallery.html

main.css

 

Each file will represent a different page on your fictitious website. The profile.html will represent your profile page while the gallery.html file will represent your gallery page. On your profile page, try adding the following:

1. A title using an h1

2. A navigation bar with 3 links:

Home -> profile.html

Profile -> profile.html

Gallery -> gallery.html

3. A picture of yourself

4. A unordered list where you identify your:

Birthday

Hobbies

Favorite TV Shows

5. Two short paragraphs describing yourself

6. A footer area with links to social media accounts that you have

Twitter -> twitter profile

Facebook -> facebook profile

 

On your gallery page, try adding the following:

1. A title using an h1

2. A navigation bar with 3 links:

Home -> profile.html

Profile -> profile.html

Gallery -> gallery.html

3. 6 photos arranged in a grid format

4. A footer area with links to social media accounts that you have

Twitter -> twitter profile

Facebook -> facebook profile

One your stylesheet, try doing the following:

1. Have the stylesheet linked to both the profile.html and gallery.html page

2. Style the following elements:

All titles

The navigation bar

The footer

The photos in the gallery page

 

The goal is not to have it be perfect but to have you try out different color combinations, fonts, sizing of text and placement of items on the page. The information on the profile itself does not have to be accurate. So be as creative as possible with the content and the design.

Completion Requirements:

The completed assignment should:

have a title of on each page
have a navigation on each page
have a stylesheet that corresponds to both pages
have styled content on both pages
have a footer on each page
2 paragraphs of bio content on the profile page
have a profile image on the profile page
have a more info section listing interests, birthday and favorite tv shows
have 6 images in their gallery page
